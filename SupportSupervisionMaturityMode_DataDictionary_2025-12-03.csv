intro_text,supervision_tool,,descriptive,"This supervision checklist is designed to assess the functionality and performance of health facilities across key thematic areas of the immunization program. 
It provides a structured approach for supervisors to evaluate service delivery practices, cold chain management, data quality, human resource capacity, community linkages, and support supervision mechanisms. 
The tool supports scoring and classification of facility performance using the maturity model (Bronze-Silver-Gold), enabling targeted mentorship, performance tracking, and continuous quality improvement across counties and sub-counties.

NB - This is an evaluation- the next time a supervision is done in November, we shall use KHIS Tracker as directed by the program",,,,,,,,,,,,,
